Critiquing your work can be a difficult and unpleasant business. You've seen better designs. You're work is sloppy and unorganized. You clearly didn't do enough research. It doesn't take much for that internal dialogue to evolve into a habit of self-deprecation. [Paul Newman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman) went so far as to take out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silver_Chalice_(film)#Newman.27s_view_on_the_movie" title="The Silver Chalice">an ad</a> to apologize for his performance in The Silver Chalice.

How many projects are abandoned based on the idea that they aren't good enough? I don't know the answer but I imagine there are a lot. For every 1 thing I do, there's probably 2 or 3 that I didn't start or left incomplete. Why does this happen?

So what is good enough?

Everyone sucks when they first do something. And no matter where you feel your skill level is at, there people better than you, worse than you, and roughly at the same level.


Intuitively we know that there's more to getting stuff done than being skilled in a single domain. For example


* Fernando Miyata - Brazilian guitarist. Stands out, has his own site. But there many many more.
    * http://www.fernandomiyata.com/
    * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATub40Npxik (live: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7yh5-y5aDA)

* Note the music in the background is absolutely terrible, as well as the overall sound quality.

It's not about being the best or about creating the definitive version of whatever it is you're working on. It's about the process you go through do it. It's about learning and . Practice is for right now, it's for the next time.


## What is talent? ##

When people say someone is talented, they must be referring to skill. No one would think that Fernando Miyata just picked up a guitar and started cranking out those licks. That kind of playing takes thousands of hours of *attentive practice*. Malcolm Gladwell says it takes 10,000 hours and others says it's [more] or it's [less] or that it's a [stupid] thing to say. I don't know if 10,000 hours is correct or whether it's even possible to distill all human endeavor down to a single amount of requisite practice, but I do know that's it absolutely not 0 hours or even 100 hours. Given that attentive practice is no swiss picnic, it would be more accurate to describe talent as



Talent is hard work.


This is what matters:

* It makes sense to you
* You're enjoying your time
