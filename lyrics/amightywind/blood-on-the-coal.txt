[ Verse 1 ]
It was april 27th, in the year of '91
About a mile below the surface and the warm Kentucky sun

The late shift was ending and the early shift was late. 
and the foreman ate his dinner from a dirty tin plate


[ Chorus ]
Blood on the tracks,
Blood in the mine,
Brothers and sisters what a terrible time (a terrible time)

Old 97 went in the wrong hole, now in my no. 60 there's 
blood on the coal
blood on the coal
blood on the coal


[ Verse 2 ]
Well, the slag pits were steamin', it was 7:25
every miner worked the coal face, every one of them alive

The train came 'round the corner, you could hear the tressel groan,
but the switcher wasn't listening so he left the switch alone

[ Chorus ]

[ Verse 3 ]
Well, the walls began to tremble and the men began to yell
they could hear that lonesome whistle like an echo out of... well

[ solo ]

'n they dropped their picks and shovels as to safety they did run
for to stay amongst the living in the year of 91

[ Chorus ] 


[ Verse 4 ]
Now and Irishman named murphy said, "I'll stop that iron horse"
as he stood a thwart its passage and it crushed him dead of course

And I hope he hears the irony, when 'er this tale is told
that the train that took his life was burning good Kentucky coal.
