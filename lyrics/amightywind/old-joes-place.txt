[ Verse 1]
Whenever I'm out a wanderin', chasing a rainbow dream
I often stop and think about a place I've never seen

Where friendly folks can gather and raise the rafters high
With songs and tales of yesteryear, until they say goodbye


[ Chorus ]
Well, there's a puppy in the parlour and a skillet on the stove
and a smelly old blanket that a Navaho wove

There's chicken on the table but you gotta say grace
There's always somethin' cookin' at Old Joe's place


[ Verse 2 ]
Now folks come by round evenin' time as soon as the sun goes down
Some drop in from right next door and some from out of town

[ solo - "pick it" ]

[ Chorus 2 ]
Well, there's a puppy in the parlour and a skillet on the stove
and a smelly old blanket that a Navaho wove

There's popcorn in the popper  and a porker in the pot 
There's pie in the pantry and the coffee's always hot

There's chicken on the table but you gotta say grace
There's always somethin' cookin' at Old Joe's place


[ Verse 3 ]
Now they don't allow no frowns inside so you better leave them by the door
There's apple brandy by the keg and sawdust on the floor

So if you've got a hankerin' I'll tell you where to go 
Just look for the busted neon sign that flashes

Eee, Aaa, ooo's

[ Chorus 2 ] 

Well, there's a puppy in the parlour and a skillet on the stove
and a smelly old blanket that a Navaho wove

There's popcorn in the popper and a porker in the pot 
There's pie in the pantry and the coffee's always hot

There's sausage in the morning and a party every night
There's a nurse on duty if you don't feel right

There's chicken on the table but you gotta say grace
There's always somethin' cookin' at Old Joe's place
