[ Pre Chorus ]
Oh when the veil of dreams is lifted,
and the fairy tales have all been told

[ Chorus ]
There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow
More precious than a pot of gold


[ Verse 1 - Mitch ]
In tales of ancient glory 
every night a maiden fair

Shall be joined when the quest is over
and a kiss is the oath that they swear

And when the veil of dreams has lifted
and the fairy tales have all been told

There's a kiss at the end of the rainbow
More precious than a pot of gold


[ Verse 2 - Mickey ]
My sweet, my dear my darling
You're so far away from me

Though an ocean of tears divides us
let the bridge of our love span the sea


[ bridge ]

your kiss... 

[ chorus ]
