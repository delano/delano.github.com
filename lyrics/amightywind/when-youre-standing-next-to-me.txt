[ Verse 1 ]
When I'm standing next to you
There's a song to sing
I know everything's feeling right

When I'm standing next to you
Steeple bells ring
only good things do I see
When you're next to me


[ Verse 2 ]
When I hold your hand in mine
A different world wakes
a new morning breaks with the sun

When I hold your hand in mine
Children's dreams take flight
Through a starlit night that's what I see. 
When you're next to me


[ Chorus ]
This love for you I'm feeling
has a power that is healing
it can mend the darkess hour
with glorious light


[ Verse 3 ]
When I taste your lips so sweet
I see begger's dine 
and the sands of time up and stop

When I taste your lips so sweet
Black and white bend 
every dove lands at your feet
when you're next to me

[ Chorus ]


[ Verse 4 ]
When I'm lying next to you
I feel moon beems burn
I see rainbows turn into gold

When I'm lying next to you
I hear angels play
I see sweeter days
I see rivers wind 
through the end of time
I see haidred fall 
from the highest hill
I see god's good grace 
shining in your eyes

That's what I see, 
When you're next to me
