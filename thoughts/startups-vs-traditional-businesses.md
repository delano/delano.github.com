Starting a company of any kind is difficult. You need to convince people to work with you and for you. You need to figure out how it will be different from the competition, what kind of culture it should have, and how to make it profitable. You might need to find investors but you'll definitely need to find people to pay you. Regardless of the business, the rule is the same: make more money than you spend.

There are also a lot of surprises. This is where startups are unique -- in the variety of surprises.

When you open a restaurant, you have a pretty good idea of what the business model is: serving food to hungry customers. There are some straight-forward questions that you need to think about: what kind of food? Where will it be located? Why will this kind of food work in that location? Once you figure that out, you need to design the menu, figure out what kind of inventory you'll need, develop relationships with suppliers, hire staff to prepare and serve the food. You'll probably also be doing a lot of renovations.

But after you open, things can change. Maybe more people prefer take-out over sitting down. Or maybe because of changes in the neighborhood there's a lot more foot-traffic around late at night rather than at lunch. These can be challenging to overcome or even devastating to the business but they're surprises that are within a reasonable context. And because they're within a reasonable context, you can figure a lot of this stuff out before opening.

Startups are different. Any part of the business can change at any time. The surprises can come at you from anywhere. Maybe instead of a restaurant, you should be a distribution center. Or a delivery service. Or maybe you became an expert in point-of-sale services and you devised a more efficient system that you can sell to other companies. Or maybe you invented a new tomato. Who knows? 

You won't know what those surprises are until you start working it.
