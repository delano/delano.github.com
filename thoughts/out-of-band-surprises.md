Starting a new business is difficult. You need to convince people to work with you and for you. You need to figure out how to differentiate it from the competition, how to make it profitable, and you need to consider what kind of culture it should have. You might need to find investors but you'll definitely need to find people to pay you. And you need to make more money than you spend (that's important). No matter what the business -- from a dentist's office to a tech company -- there are common challenges.

And then come the surprises.

When you open a restaurant, you have a pretty good idea of what the business model is: serving food to hungry customers. You have a few early decisions: what kind of food will you make? Where will it be located? Why will this kind of food work in that area? Once you decide on the concept and location, you need to design the menu, work out an inventory, develop relationships with suppliers, hire staff. And you'll probably be doing a lot of renovations.

But after the doors open, things change. Contrary to your estimates, you're selling 2-to-1 take-out over sit-down meals. People love the specials but the regular menu is a dud. One of your suppliers is chronically late with a key ingredient. These challenges can be difficult to overcome or even devastating but they're surprises that are within a reasonable context. *You can expect them.* And because you can expect them, you can plan for them.

Startups are different. Any part of the business can change at any time. The surprises are out-of-band. That is to say, it's difficult or impossible to imagine where the surprises will come from. That's why listening to and understanding your customers is so important. Continuing with the restaurant analogy, maybe instead of a restaurant, there's a bigger opportunity in importing and distributing that key ingredient. Or maybe your. Or maybe you became an expert in point-of-sale services and you devised a more efficient system that you can sell to other companies. Or maybe you invented a new tomato. Who knows? 

You won't know what those surprises are until you start working on the business.
